Advanced Data Analytics Lessons

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Introduction to Big Data Tools (Hadoop & Spark)
=========================================================
Summary:
Big data tools handle massive datasets beyond traditional databases.
Hadoop â†’ distributed storage (HDFS) + processing (MapReduce)
Spark â†’ faster, in-memory computation

Example:
E-commerce companies use Spark to process petabytes of transaction logs for recommendations.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: Python â€“ Advanced Pandas
=========================================
Summary:
Beyond basics, Pandas supports:
groupby() with multiple aggregations
Time-series resampling
Merging complex datasets

Example:
Analyze daily hospital patient admissions, resample to weekly averages, and merge with seasonal data.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Predictive Analytics â€“ Regression Models
=======================================================
Summary:
Regression predicts continuous outcomes.
Linear Regression â†’ simple relationships
Multiple Regression â†’ many variables
Regularization (Lasso/Ridge) â†’ prevent overfitting

Example:
Predict hospital costs based on age, diagnosis, and length of stay.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: SQL Optimization & Performance Tuning
===================================================
Summary:
Large queries can be slow. Optimization helps improve performance.
Use indexes
Avoid SELECT *
Use EXPLAIN to analyze queries

Example:
Adding an index on patient_id sped up query time from 15s â†’ 2s.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Case Study â€“ Healthcare Predictive Analytics
========================================================
Summary:
Steps:
-------
Collect patient data (demographics, history, visits)
Use Pandas for cleaning & transformations
Apply regression models for readmission prediction
Optimize queries for performance in reporting

Example:
Hospital reduced readmission rates by 12% with predictive modeling.
